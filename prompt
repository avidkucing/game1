Lets finalize the game idea. For now, this will be an auto shooter endless battle with futuristic theme and planes as the hero.
I want to call it Airforce Mayhem: Endless.
Fow now, there will be an Endless stage, but more kind of stages will be available in the future.
In the battles, the player will be in the bottom while enemies appear on the upper part of the screen. 
Player will be able to pick up power ups on the stage that upgrades their weapon according to some upgrade trees.
There will be multiple planes with different weapon type, for now built one with the projectile type.
Scores will be calculated based on score multiplier and time survived. Score multiplier is set before the stage, and correspond to the stage difficulty.
There will be highscore ranking.
Each stage will cost energy. Energy refresh overtime.
